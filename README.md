#Using [ HTML, CSS, Javascript ] 
-----------------------------------
- Build a financial calculator widget to be put on a website that takes 4 
numbers from the user and calculates the percentage of each brand 
```
[ Brex,Stripe,Amex ] 
```
 
- Only if you click on each button an automatic result would appear relative to 
the branded button as the second image. 
 
- But for the results of unlimited rewards and lifetime rewards will be 
calculated and appear automatically once the user has entered the 4 
numbers. 

#Sum = ( Vendor/Bills + Media/Ad + Corporation spend+ Team project ) 
-
#Brex = sum* 0.3 
=
#Stripe = sum *2.9 
=
#Amex = sum * 1.3 
=
#unlimited rewards = sum * 1.1 
=
#lifetime rewards = sum *1.2
